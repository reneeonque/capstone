         <p>Women are the fastest growing population of incarcerated people, and 80% of these women are mothers.</p>

         <p>A 2004 Bureau of Justice Statistics <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/bjs/mpp.pdf">survey</a> found that 3% of women in federal prisons and 4% in state prisons reported that they were pregnant at intake, as mentioned in a recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6459671/">study</a>. These percentages could have increased over the past 17 years, but data that would show how many pregnant women are incarcerated is not being collected on a large scale.</p>

         <p>Advocates, like Carolyn Sufrin, are collecting this data on their own by calling prisons and asking inmates for the number of pregnant women within their facility. Sufrin hopes to paint the bigger picture of how many women are giving birth while in the carceral system.</p>

         <p>TK Quote from Carolyn Sufrin</p>

         <p>From state to state, opinions about the living experiences of pregnant women who are incarcerated vary. Depending on the location, the prenatal, birthing and postpartum experiences for birthers in prison looks very different. Some states have a long way to go.</p>

         <p>Shackling women who are incarcerated while they are giving birth is a common practice, but over the years, certain states have adopted regulations to prohibit the use of restraints during labor for their imprisoned populations. However, six states&ndash;Georgia, South Carolina, Indiana, Kansas, Utah, and Nebraska&ndash;&ndash;have &ldquo;no policies in effect banning or restricting the shackling of female inmates in labor,&rdquo; as stated in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/these-states-still-allow-shackling-inmates-during-childbirth.html">The Cut</a>.</p>

         <p>Restraining women in transport to prenatal care and during labor and delivery can obstruct necessary medical care and, during labor, lead to extreme physical pain and complications because of the mother&rsquo;s inability to move freely,&rdquo; according to the <a href="https://eji.org/news/shackling-of-pregnant-women-in-jails-and-prisons-continues/">Equal Justice Initiative</a> and the <a href="https://www.apa.org/advocacy/criminal-justice/shackling-incarcerated-women.pdf">American Psychological Association</a>.</p>

         <p>Other states are working extremely hard to change the circumstances of pregnant women in the system.</p>

               <h1>New York</h1>
               <p>By the time Sharel Jones was in her late twenties, she&rsquo;d been to Rikers Island more times than she could remember. Most of the times she was sent to jail was for possessing drugs or a crime she committed in pursuit of them, similar to most women who are incarcerated in New York. At that in her life, Jones had been struggling with addiction for more than a decade so when she found out she was pregnant during intake at Rikers Island, she had mixed feelings.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;I was suffering from a lot of mental health issues. I was scared for the first time in my life,&rdquo; Jones explained. &ldquo;I was facing prison time. And it's like, what am I going to do with a kid? I'm not finished running the streets.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>Jones had already given birth to two children before her Rikers Island surprise, but she remembers little from the pregnancy and birthing experience because of her drug addiction. Her other two boys were living with family members and Jones said she never had to face the reality of being their mom full-time. Being incarcerated with this pregnancy meant Jones had little access to drugs and more of an obligation to parent, and that was terrifying.</p>

               <p>New York is unique because it&rsquo;s one of only eight states in the country that allows pregnant people to keep their children after giving birth for up to a year in a special nursery program. When Jones learned she was 13 weeks pregnant, she was placed in a separate facility at the Rose M. Singer center women&rsquo;s jail on Rikers, one that had other pregnant people, pastel colored walls and all the baby gear she&rsquo;d need. Jones also got to participate in a lullaby program with Carnegie Hall where she wrote and recorded a song for her newbon.</p>

               <iframe class="audioPlayer" width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1158084688&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
               
               <p>&ldquo;You wouldn't know that that's a part of the jail, the nursery,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very different. It&rsquo;s just like outside.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>On Thanksgiving day in 2012, Jones&rsquo; son, Ariyon, was born. Jones chose her son&rsquo;s birthday, opting for a cesarean section at the advice of her doctor and decided giving birth would be a better, more joyous way to spend the holiday.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;They later on brought me my son and I'm like, Oh my God. It's about to get real,&rdquo; Jones recalls. &ldquo;I had never changed Pampers. I had never did the milk thing with my kids. I didn't have to do those things.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>Ariyon was able to live with his mom inside of Rikers Island for the first four months of his life. His older brothers sometimes tease him about the fact that he was born in jail but Jones says he brushes it off. She never hid her struggles with her kids and likes that they can now talk freely about such complicated memories.</p>

               <p>Jones was later sentenced to 1.5-3 years following the birth of Ariyon and was sent upstate to Bedford Hills Women&rsquo;s Prison where there&rsquo;s also a nursery program, but it was difficult for Jones to be accepted to it because of the nature of her crime. Though she was able to gain access to the program through some advocacy from family members, Jones was quickly disenrolled because she got into a fight with another woman.</p>

               <blockquote>
                  I feel like no one is going to raise my child like I would.
               </blockquote>
               
               <p>Dr. Lorie Goshin is an Associate Professor at Hunter College&rsquo;s Bellevue School of Nursing whose work centers research on pregnant people in New York&rsquo;s carceral system. She says the criteria for entry into a prison nursery program is limited to non-violent offenders, people who don&rsquo;t have a history of child welfare involvement and sometimes they barr people on psychotropic medications.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;And when you take a group of women and you pull out all the women who fit any of those criteria, you don't have a lot of people left, because if you fit that criteria, you shouldn't be in prison anyway. It's often that there aren't a lot of women that these programs would serve,&rdquo; Dr. Goshin said.</p>

               <p>Even so, Dr. Goshin thinks pregnant people shouldn&rsquo;t go to jail or prison at all, instead, she&rsquo;d rather see them placed in incarceration alternatives like residential treatment programs or supportive housing. One of Dr. Goshin&rsquo;s studies looked at the long-term effects of babies kept in prison nursery programs with their moms, comparing their developmental outcomes to those of children who were separated from their mothers due to incarceration. She and the other researchers found that the babies kept with their mothers did have some better mental health outcomes. But that study didn&rsquo;t account for another possibility.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;We did not compare those kids to kids who had been able to stay with their moms in a supportive community setting. So something like supportive housing where the mom got the support that she needed for, for example, history of trauma, or substance use disorder, or homelessness or whatever created her pathway to incarceration,&rdquo; Dr. Goshin explained. &ldquo;We were not unable to compare to that experience, which I believe would be a better approach to pregnant people who are involved in the criminal legal system.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>When Sharon White-Harrigan was serving a 10-year prison sentence for manslaughter at Bedford Hills, she was already a mom to a young daughter. White-Harrigan did not give birth to her child while incarcerated but being in prison nonetheless had a detremential affect on her daugher. White-Harrigan says she struggled with arranging care for her child from miles away upstate and wrestled with the thought of her visiting, not wanting her child to deal with the hassle and emotional toll of seeing her mom in prison.</p>

               <div class="graphic">
                  <img src="https://picsum.photos/1280/720" />
               </div>
               
               <p>&ldquo;It was tough when you have children, I feel like no one is going to raise my child like I would,&rdquo; said White-Harrigan. &ldquo;And during the years, it just was really, just really difficult.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>When White-Harrigan was in Bedford Hills, she unintentionally started her activism from the inside, making her way through different positions on the Inmate Liason Commitee which acts as a middleman between the prison population and the administration. White-Harrigan served as secretary treasurer, vice president and eventually president where she pushed for things like washer and dryer accessibility and beauty tools for when the women had special events or court dates.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;I just went into action. It wasn&rsquo;t anything that anyone taught me. I just felt like, people deserve to have,&rdquo; White-Harrigan said.</p>

               <p>After her release, White-Harrigan has continued her advocacy for women involved with the carceral system, now serving as executive director of the Women&rsquo;s Community Justice Association where her main goal is similar to that of Dr. Goshin&rsquo;s: for women to not go to jail or prison at all, instead fighting for community alternatives.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;One of our recommendations is to divert pregnant women. So that means that they wouldn't go to Rikers or any other kind of secured facility in that way that there will be a place where they can be nurtured, where children could be nurtured,&rdquo; White-Harrigan said. &ldquo;We understand that pregnant women commit crimes and get in trouble. But we also think that the children, the unborn children should not be subjected to any kind of harm, or in any way be a part of that process.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>In her vision, White-Harrigan imagines residential treatment programs or supportive housing that treats the problem rather than punishes the person. In this alternative reality, White-Harrigan says families wouldn&rsquo;t be separated, which is a vital option for the over 80% of women who are parents and oftentimes primary caregivers for their children and families.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;I've heard people in the community say, Well, you know, if she was worried about the kid, you wouldn't commit a crime. Right? And so, you know, some people don't feel like there should be any specialized treatment for people once because they don't know how to separate the act from the person,&rdquo; White-Harrigan explained.</p>

               <p>Models like these already exist in New York, Dr. Goshin said, like one managed by the Women&rsquo;s Community Justice Project, which bears a similar name to the WCJA White-Harrigan heads but is different in that it provides housing and treatment alternatives. But, as Dr. Goshin explains, enough resources aren&rsquo;t being put into them as a viable solution.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;Their early outcomes have been excellent in that they've been able to keep women safe in the community, some of whom were pregnant, and their more recent work is providing supportive housing to women and their children. So either coming directly in with kids if the person has current custody, or allowing the mom to reunify,&rdquo; Dr. Goshin said. &ldquo;But it's a relatively small program. And certainly receives a lot less resources and support, than Rikers Island and just need a locking women up.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>&ldquo;We need help, not jail,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;What we have to start doing is in our homes and in our communities finding other ways because the pain stems from something. We don't just wake up and say, Hey, today, I'm going to smoke crack. Today, I just want to try heroin. We're trying to numb something, we don't want to think about something. And I think if we get more community centers if we get more women on health services, it'll be much better it'll be much better.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>Jones has since been in recovery from her addiction for six years. She doesn&rsquo;t live with her children, but still maintains a relationship with them. She says her time on Rikers Island didn&rsquo;t do much to help her address her traumas, treat her addiction or restore that relationship with her children. Jones said that took the work of her will and support on the outside.</p>

               <p>White-Harrigan has also struggled with her relationship with her daughter. Now an adult, her daughter spent most of her life not in her mom&rsquo;s care. When White-Harrigan thinks back to her time at Bedford Hills, she says the most meaningful support she received was from fellow incarcerated women, most of whom were also mothers, dealing with similar strives as she. It&rsquo;s what drives her continued advocacy work on the outside.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;We have a real sisterhood, a real comradery. The good, the bad, the ugly, the right, the wrong, the indifferent,&rdquo; said White-Harrigan. &ldquo;I think that there's this unspoken connection with all of us. Whether we know each other, or you came behind me, or you left before me, there's this unspoken connection that you know, we're sisters.&rdquo;</p>

               <h1>Minnesota</h1>
               <p>One of the first states in the country to make progressive changes for birthers in prison was Minnesota.</p>

               <p>Advocates in Minnesota have been trying to provide prison birth support in the state since 2004, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 2010 that <a href="https://www.mnprisondoulaproject.org/">The Minnesota Prison Doula Project</a> was formed. The organization gives resources to pregnant women at the Minnesota Correctional Facility &ndash;&ndash; Shakopee (MCF-Shakopee) through access to doula care, weekly parenting support groups, one-on-one counseling for incarcerated parents and supportive visitation that allows parents to see their children during one-hour visits.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;From an evolutionary and ethical standpoint, moms and babies need to be together,&rdquo; said Rebecca Shlafer, a child psychologist and research director at the Minnesota Doula Project, &ldquo;The first caregiver sets the foundation.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>After learning that babies were being separated from their mothers a day after being born, Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, who brought the issue to the governor&rsquo;s attention, worked closely with the Minnesota Prison Doula Project to find a solution.</p>

               <blockquote>
                  Many of these women were going to be released within the next six months anyway.
               </blockquote>
               
               <p>In May of this year, Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/news/?id=1055-482190">signed</a> the Minnesota Department of Corrections Healthy Start Act, a law that allows pregnant women who are incarcerated to live with their babies for up to one year post-birth&ndash;&ndash;if they meet certain qualifications.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;The reality is that the vast majority of these women are not in for violent offenses,&rdquo; said Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, who brought the law to the governor&rsquo;s attention, &ldquo;Many of these women were going to be released within the next six months anyway.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>In fact, the <a href="https://www.senate.mn/committees/2021-2022/3099_Committee_on_Judiciary_and_Public_Safety_Finance_and_Policy/Healthy%20Start%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20SF%201315.pdf">Minnesota Department of Corrections</a> found that 77% of the pregnant women who served time at MCF-Shakopee between 2013 and 2020 were sentenced for less than nine months.</p>

               <p><a href="https://becker-finn.org/about/">Rep. Becker-Finn</a> sits on the Minnesota House of Representatives and is a descendant of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe. Native people are incarcerated at a disproportionately higher rate than other racial groups in Minnesota, she says.</p>

               <p>&ldquo;One of my parents was incarcerated when I was a kid, so issues around the broader impacts of incarceration on families and communities have always been really important to me,&rdquo; said Rep. Becker-Finn.</p>

               <p>According to the <a href="https://www.senate.mn/committees/2021-2022/3099_Committee_on_Judiciary_and_Public_Safety_Finance_and_Policy/Healthy%20Start%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%20SF%201315.pdf">Minnesota Department of Corrections</a>, a study that examined visitations between mothers in prison and their children found that &ldquo;on average, caregivers lived 117 minutes (almost 2 hours)&rdquo; from the Minnesota Correctional Facility &ndash;&ndash; Shakopee. Of the guardians that the children of incarcerated mothers at MCF-Shakopee lived with, 56% reported &ldquo;never taking the baby for visits to the prison.&rdquo;</p>

               <h1>Alabama</h1>
               <p>Following Minnesota&rsquo;s lead, Alabama formed the <a href="https://www.prisonbirth.org/">Alabama Prison Birth Project</a>, in connection with the Ostara Initiative, the program that founded the Minnesota Prison Doula Project. Most of the services mirror that of Minnesota&rsquo;s, but the Mother&rsquo;s Milk Initiative is unique to Alabama&rsquo;s program.</p>

               <blockquote>
                  With this option, she can provide some form of everyday care, even as someone else cares for her baby.
               </blockquote>

               <p>The Mother&rsquo;s Milk Initiative allows mothers who are incarcerated to pump their breast milk while in prison and send it to their babies on the outside. &ldquo;We overnight the milk on dry ice to the infant's caregiver. Only a mother can give her baby breast milk designed for that baby, and with this option, she can provide a form of everyday care, even as someone else cares for her baby,&rdquo; states the program&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.prisonbirth.org/services">site</a>.</p>

               <p>It took over a year to get the breast milk program in place, according to Chauntel Norris, a certified lactation counselor and doula at the Alabama Prison Birth Project. Now that it is available for mothers who are incarcerated within their state, &ldquo;roughly 80% of women in the Alabama Prison Birth Project choose to breastfeed,&rdquo; she said.</p>

               <p>As a doula in the program, Norris is able to provide moral support for birthers, by &ldquo;making it a joyful occasion.&rdquo;</p>

               <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll dress the baby up, take pictures and do all the normal ceremony that is associated with having a new baby,&rdquo; said Norris, &ldquo;After mom goes back to the facility, the doula will come and meet with her within three days and bring pictures from the birth.&rdquo;</p>

               </div>
               
               <p>Norris added that moms are allowed to have 15 pictures from their birth with them, giving them the opportunity to have pictures of their newborn. The option to take pictures of their newborns wasn&rsquo;t available to women who gave birth while incarcerated in the state prior to the program.</p>
